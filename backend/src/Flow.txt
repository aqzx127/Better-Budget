# Backend Example Flow (MVC-Architecture):
    User Registration:
        1. The frontend sends a request to register a new user.
        2. The request hits a route like POST /api/users.
        3. Express routes the request to the appropriate controller function.
        4. The controller validates the request data.
        5. If valid, the controller uses the User model to create a new user in the database.
        6. The controller sends a response (e.g., success message, new user data).

# File Structure Example:
models/
    userModel.js - Sequelize model for users.
controllers/
    userController.js - Functions to handle user-related requests.
routes/
    userRoutes.js - Express routes related to users.
middlewares/
    authMiddleware.js - Middleware for JWT verification.
database/
    db-config.js - Sequelize configuration and connection.
    
server.js - Main server file setting up Express and routes.



# Still TODO #

- Store JWT in cookies on the frontend
- Persist Session via Stored JWT on page reload/navigation
- Implement Session Expiry and Token Refreshing
- Secure the Tokens
